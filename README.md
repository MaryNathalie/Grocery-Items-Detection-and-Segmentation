# Grocery Items Detection and Segmentation

This repository contains the implementation of a YOLO-based object detection and segmentation model for grocery items. The project focuses on improving model accuracy and real-time inference speed, with deployment via a web-based application using Gradio and WebRTC.

### üìå Features
- COCO-formatted **Dataset Preparation** into YOLO format, ensuring bounding boxes and segmentations remain within image boundaries.
- **Object Detection & Segmentation** using YOLO.
- **Dataset Augmentation** via Albumentations.
- **Experiment Tracking** with CometML.
- **Live Webcam Inference** powered by WebRTC and Twilio API.
- **Web-Based UI** using Gradio.
- **Optimized Training Pipeline** with hyperparameter tuning.

### üìä Dataset Summary

The dataset consists of images of grocery items. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, translation, shear, and mixup were applied to improve model robustness.

### üèó Model Training

The project initially used the YOLO11-Nano model but later upgraded to YOLO11-Medium for better accuracy. The training pipeline is configured as follows:

```python
model.train(
  data="dataset.yaml",
  project="MEX6_runners",
  epochs=200,
  imgsz=640,
  batch=16,
  patience=10,
  name="run02",
  
  degrees=30,
  hsv_v=0.3,
  translate=0.4,
  shear=0.3,
  flipud=0.05,
  mixup=0.4,
  copy_paste=0.3
)
```

### üîß Data Augmentations

- HSV_V (0.3): Adjust brightness for lighting variations.
- Translate (0.4): Detect partially visible objects.
- Degrees (30): Rotate images to recognize orientations.
- Shear (0.3): Simulate different viewing angles.
- FlipUD (0.05): Introduce variability without distorting objects.
- Mixup (0.4): Blend images for better generalization.
- Copy-Paste (0.3): Increase object instances and occlusion.

### üåç Web-Based Deployment

- WebRTC Configuration
  - Uses Twilio API Tokens to configure ICE servers for smooth real-time webcam streaming.
  - Establishes peer-to-peer (P2P) connections for low-latency inference.
- Gradio Interface
  - WebRTC Stream for real-time detection.
  - Confidence Threshold Slider for adjustable detection sensitivity.

### üöÄ Deploying the Gradio App

Deploy the Gradio interface with app.py, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository

```python
git clone 
```

2. Install dependencies:

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:

```python
python app.py
```

4. Access the web interface. If deploying on a remote server, use share=True in gr.Interface.launch() to get a public link.

### üìà Results

- Comparing models with and without additional data augmentation:
- Improved segmentation and classification accuracy.
- Reduced box loss, class loss, segmentation loss, and DF1 loss.
- Increased computational efficiency with optimized hyperparameters.

### üõ† Next Steps

- Deploy ONNX inference with onnxruntime.InferenceSession().
- Perform hyperparameter tuning with Ray Tune.
- Experiment with YOLO11-X for enhanced accuracy.
- Collect more real-world images to improve generalization.
- Implement frame aggregation for smoother predictions.
